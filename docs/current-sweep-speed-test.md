# Current Sweep Speed Test

How fast is the tool? How many measurements can be made every second? What is the minimum time interval between two measurements? We have experimentally tested the performance of the available SMU instrument.

In this experiment we tried to push the instrument to it's maximum speed using the following configuration: 

```lua

-- setting for maximum speed 
smu.source.delay=0
smu.source.readback = smu.OFF
smu.measure.nplc = 0.01
smu.measure.autozero.enable = smu.OFF
smu.measure.autozero.once()

```

`smu.source.readback = smu.ON` mean that the output of the measure will include the measured source singal levels while with `smu.source.readback = smu.OFF` the programmed value is used. The source signal measure is executed immidiatly before the measure signal measuremnt. This additional measure require some time and increase the overall time required for each messuremt.

`smu.source.delay=0` allow to control the delay between two measures only with `delay` paramer `function`.

NPLC Set the amount of time that the input signal is measured is specified in parameters that are based on the number of power line cycles (NPLCs). Lower NPLC settings result in faster reading rates, but increased noise. Higher NPLC settings result in lower reading noise, but slower reading rates.

Each power line cycle for 60 Hz is 16.67 ms (1/60); for 50Hz, it is 20 ms (1/50).

The shortest amount of time results in the fastest reading rate, but increases the reading noise and decreases the number of usable digits.
The longest amount of time provides the lowest reading noise and more usable digits, but has the slowest reading rate.

## Experimental Results

The experiment has been repeted with various combination of NPLC and delay parameters.

Reducing delay to 10ms (0.01s) there is some jittering on the measurement interval

When we try to set a 1ms delay we get a measurement interval that is longer than 1ms.

Il limite inferiore di circa 1-2 mS per l'intervallo tra le diverse misurazioni eseguite nel source sweep Ã¨ coerente con quanto riportato nel manuale di riverimento al paragrafo "source dealy" (pag. 4-46)

## Conclusions

The minimum internva between two measurement is between 1 and 2 ms. This is compatilbe with section in the reference manual "source delay" in reference manual. (page 4-46)
